1. Array objects are in heap. 
2. Heap objects are not continuous. 
3. In arrays, Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) is used. 
4. Hence, array may or may not be continuous -> It depends on JVM (Java Virtual Machine). 

#### Primitive Data Types 
The data types which can't be further broken down into smaller parts. It includes data types
like int, char, float, boolean, etc. 

#### Non-Primitive Data Types
These are complex data types which can be further broken down. It includes data types like
Arrays, String (can be broken down into characters), etc. 

##ArrayList<>
1. In the array lists the size of input doesn't matter, since it can take as many inputs as you want even after
declaring a specific size. 
2. To insert elements we use objectname.add() and to print we directly use System.out.println(objectname_Arraylist);
3. To print the arraylist using for loop and to get the value at an index, we use, objectname.get(index value(i in case of for loop)).
